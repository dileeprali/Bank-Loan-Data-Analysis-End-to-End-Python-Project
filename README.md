# 1. Problem Statement
The objective of this project is to analyze a bankâ€™s loan dataset to evaluate lending performance, repayment patterns, and borrower profiles.
This analysis will help the bank:
- Monitor total loan applications and Month-to-Date (MTD) performance
- Track funded amounts and amounts received
- Evaluate loan quality (Good Loans vs. Bad Loans)
- Assess portfolio risk through interest rates and debt-to-income (DTI) ratios
- Understand seasonal trends, regional differences, and borrower demographics
# 2.  KPI Requirements
| **KPI** | **Description** |
|---------|-----------------|
| Total Loan Applications | Count of all loan applications in the dataset |
| MTD Loan Applications | Applications received in the current month |
| Total Funded Amount | Total value of loans disbursed |
| MTD Funded Amount | Loan amounts disbursed in the current month |
| Total Amount Received | Total repayments received from borrowers |
| MTD Amount Received | Repayments collected in the current month |
| Average Interest Rate | Mean interest rate applied to loans |
| Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI) | Mean borrower DTI ratio |

# 3.  Good Loan vs. Bad Loan KPIs
# Good Loans â€“ Loans with status "Fully Paid" or "Current":
- Good Loan Application Percentage
- Good Loan Applications (Count)
- Good Loan Funded Amount
- Good Loan Total Received Amount

# Bad Loans â€“ Loans with status "Charged Off":
- Bad Loan Application Percentage
- Bad Loan Applications (Count)
- Bad Loan Funded Amount
- Bad Loan Total Received Amount

# 4. Charts & Visualizations
This project includes the following visualizations:
1. Monthly Trends by Issue Date â€“ Area/Line Chart showing seasonality in lending activity
2. Regional Analysis by State â€“ Horizontal Bar Chart for funded amounts by state.
3. Loan Term Analysis â€“ Donut Chart showing distribution between 36-month and 60-month loans.
4. Employment Length Analysis â€“ Bar Chart showing lending metrics by employment length.
5. Loan Purpose Breakdown â€“ Bar Chart of loans by stated purpose.

# Banking & Finance Terminology
* Loan Status â€“ Current condition of the loan (Fully Paid, Current, Charged Off)
* Funded Amount â€“ Actual amount disbursed to the borrower
* Amount Received â€“ Total repayments made by the borrower
* DTI (Debt-to-Income) â€“ Ratio of borrowerâ€™s debt payments to income
* Interest Rate â€“ Annual cost of borrowing
* Term â€“ Loan repayment duration (e.g., 36 or 60 months)
* Charged Off â€“ Loan deemed uncollectible
* Loan Portfolio â€“ Aggregate of all loans held by the bank

ðŸ’¡ In future iterations, this project can be expanded into a real-time analytics dashboard and integrated with predictive machine learning models to forecast loan defaults.
